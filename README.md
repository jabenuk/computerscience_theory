# GCSE Computer Science coursework + theory

This is a repository to store all my GCSE computer science work. Numbering systems are not necessarily the same as those used in the official OCR specification, but it's for my use anyway. Some of the documents may be useful to others, though, so they're all public.

## Theory

### Component 01: Computer systems (50%)
 - [1.1 Systems architecture](/theory/01/SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
 - [1.2 Memory](/theory/01/MEMORY.md)
 - [1.3 Storage](/theory/01/STORAGE.md)

### Component 02: Computational thinking, algorithms, and programming (50%)
**TBA.**

⚠️ some of the above content is not necessary for the GCSE course, see the official specification (if available) for guidance. ⚠️
