# 1.8 Ethical, legal, cultural, and environmental concerns

## 1.8.1 Investigating and discussing Computer Science technologies

This section details how to investigate and discuss Computer Science technologies whilst considering the following:

### Ethical issues

#### Ensuring public safety
As new technology is introduced, it brings safety concerns - e.g. driverless cars.

#### Data security
Personal data must be kept safe. Some people attempt to hack systems in order to gain access to other people's data. Social media accounts and networks are especially prone to hacking.

### Legal issues

Computers might be used unlawfully in many ways, e.g.:
 - allowing someone to illegally share personal data
 - helping to steal financial information
 - helping to illegally copy and distribute films
 - extorting information
 - blackmail

To help protect people, several laws have been introduced in the United Kingdom:
 1) The [Data Protection Act of 1998 & 2018](#1998-data-protection-act)
 2) The [Computer Misuse Act of 1990](#1990-computer-misuse-act)
 3) The [Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988](#1988-copyright-designs-and-patents-act)
 4) [Creative Commons licensing](#creative-commons-licensing)
 5) The [Freedom of Information Act of 2000](#2000-freedom-of-information-act)

## 1.8.2 The effects of technologies on key stakeholders

A **stakeholder** is anyone who is impacted by the actions of an organisation and this may include individuals, groups, manufacturers, or business owners.

## 1.8.3 The environmental impact of Computer Science

Environmental issues relate to the negative impacts that the manufacturing and use of computers has on the environment. Resources are necessary for computers to be produced, distributed, and used. Metal and plastics are used to manufacture components, and energy is expended in distributing equipment and in using it.

Many computers, such as **web servers**, **DNSs**, and **data centers** need to be left running continuously, requiring lots of energy.

Users often discard IT equipment quicky:
 - people have new phones every few years
 - idiots have new phones every single year
 - many organisations replace computers after 3 or 4 years
 - many people replace old technology due to the perception of it being 'out of date'

All of this means **computers have a heavy environment impact.** This is unlikely to change in the near future.

## 1.8.4 The cultural implications of Computer Science

#### The digital divide
The **digital divide** is the division that exists between those who can use technology and those who cannot. For example, younger people may embrace new technology more than older people - the use of social media is a prime example of this.

This division extends to those who can afford new technology and those who cannot. The UK is prosperous with high standards of living, but many people live in countries where access to computers is expensive and unaffordable. Furthermore, people in cities tend to have access to high-speed broadband, while those in rural or remote areas often do not.

Another example of the digital divide is between those who have good computer skills and those who don't.

#### The changing nature of employment
Many companies now allow employees to work from home and communicate via technology. Cloud-based document storage is a common occurence in the modern workplace.

Many organisations have outsourced call centres in other countries. The cost of communication with people in those countries is outweighed by the savings being made.

Automation of processes using technology has led to a fall in manual, low-skilled work, such as warehouse packing. On the other hand, more high-skilled work is now available, which includes the maintenance of said systems.

## 1.8.5 The argument of Proprietary Software vs. FOSS

### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

Open-source software can be free of copyright and is usually available to anyone. Keep in mind the 'free' in 'free-and-open-source-software' refers to being free as in **freedom** (like **free**dom of speech) rather than free as in cost.

There are several advantages:
 - it costs nothing and the source code is provided
 - it can have many authors
 - some licenses (e.g. the [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)) enforce that any forks/derivatives must also be made freely available

However, there are also disadvantages:
 - there may be more bugs[^1]
 - support might not be readily available if the program is not in widespread use

Examples of open source software include:
 - **Linux** operating system
 - **Firefox** browser
 - **GIMP** (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
 - **Apache** web server
 - **Python** 'programming language'

### Proprietary software

Proprietary software is software that is copyrighted, and can only be obtained via a - usually paid - license.

There are some advantages:
 - the software **should** be free of bugs *(unless it is made by Microsoft)* and **patches** should be released to fix any
 - help can be sought from the organisation that owns the software
 - widespread proprietary software often has good support

There are also disadvantages, though:
 - there is an initial or ongoing/subscription cost
 - only binaries are distributed, rather than the source code of the sofware
 - proprietary software, not being open-source, may not work on lesser-used operating systems such as Linux or BSD
 - users may not redistribute the software, depending on the license

Examples of proprietary software include:
 - **Windows and OSX** operating systems
 - **Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite** productivity software
 - The majority of games

## 1.8.6 Legislation relevant to Computer Science

### 1998 Data Protection Act

The **Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998** was replaced by the GDPR in 2018 - at least, in Europe. Due to [bad political decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit), however, the GDPR had to be implemented in the UK via the Data Protection Act **2018.**

#### Key principles in the Data Protection Acts of 1998 and 2018 respectively
| DPA 1998 | DPA 2018 |
| - | - |
| Personal data must be fairly and lawfully processed | Personal data must be fairly and lawfully processed |
| Personal data must be obtained for specified and lawful purposes | Personal data must be obtained for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes |
| Personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive | Personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive |
| Personal data must be accurate and up to date | Personal data must be accurate and up to date |
| Personal data must not be kept for longer than is necessary | Personal data must not be kept for longer than is necessary |
| Personal data must be processed in line with your rights | Personal data must be handled in a way that ensures security |
| Personal data must be held securely | |
| Personal data must not be transferred to other countries outside the European Economic Area | |

For the OCR GCSE course, only the **DPA 1998** column should be important. But it's worth knowing the 2018 equivalent anyways, since it is relevant.

### 1990 Computer Misuse Act

There are three separate parts to the **Computer Misuse Act (CMA) 1990**:
 1. It is illegal to access data stored on a computer unless you have permission to do so. Unauthorised access is often referred to as hacking.
 2. It is illegal to access data on a computer when that material will be used to commit further illegal activity, such as fraud or blackmail.
 3. It is illegal to make changes to any data stored on a computer when the user does not have permission to do so. If you access and change the contents of someone’s files without their permission, you are breaking the law. This includes installing a virus or other malware which damages or changes the way the computer works.

**The *maximum* punishment for breaking this law is a £5,000 fine *or* several years' imprisonment.**

Intent **must** be proved. If a computer is not well protected, someone could accidentally change its data by accident. **If anyone is to be found guilty, it must be evident that they intentionally accessed and modified data.**

### 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents Act

**Copyright** is a legal means of ensuring that content creators can protect their work. **Copyright does not apply to ideas.*

Copyright is applied automatically as long as criteria is met - no © emblem necessary - unless the copyright holder chooses to give that right away (see the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)). In the UK, copyright on an artistic work, literature, music, and films lasts for **70 years after the death of the creator.**

There are some situations where it is legal to copy, publish, distribute, or sell copyrighted material. These are:
 - when you are the copyright holder
 - when you have the copyright holder's permission
 - when the copyright holder has chosen to give up their copyright

### Creative Commons licensing

CC (**Creative Commons**) licenses help copyright owners share their work whilst keeping copyright. In the UK, there are several CC licenses:

| License | Description |
| - | - |
| Attribution | The work can be copied, modified, distributed, displayed and performed but **the copyright owner must be given credit**. |
| Non-commercial | The work can be copied, modified, distributed and displayed but **no profit can be made from it**. |
| No derivative works | The work can be copied, distributed, displayed and performed but **cannot be modified**. |
| Share-alike | The work can be modified and distributed but **must be covered by an identical licence**. |

Creative commons licensing must first be granted by the copyright holder before people use the work. For example; just because images are available on the internet does not mean it has a CC license.

### 2000 Freedom of Information Act

The **Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000** was introduced to give the public the right to access any information stored by **public sector organisations,** including that from:
 - schools
 - councils
 - government departments
 - health trusts + hospitals
 - libraries
 - museums

**Anyone is able to request information** - requests must be in writing (by letter or by email) and then the organisation has **20 working days** to fulfil it.

Organisations are excluded from providing information if:
 - the information is sensitive, in which case the **[Data Protection Act](#1998-data-protection-act)** takes precendence
 - the information will be too costly or time-consuming to produce - for public organisations, the cost limit is **£450**, and for the govt., the limit is increased to **£600**.

[^1]: This is directly taken from the source cited in the [references](#references). It is arguably **not a valid point!** Proprietary software can have bugs too - the difference is that you then rely on the sole company (that owns the software) to fix the bugs, rather than being able to expect someone from the community to fix them. OCR may expect this disadvantage, but I personally *strongly* disagree with its validity.
