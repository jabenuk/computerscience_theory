# 2.8 Flowcharts

Flowcharts are sometimes known as flow diagrams.

Flowcharts make it easy to display the flow + possible paths of an algorithm, but they can also become huge in size and unwieldy to follow. They follow an international standard. However, any changes to the design of the program may mean a lot of the flow diagram has to be redrawn.
