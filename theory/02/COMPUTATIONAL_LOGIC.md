# 2.6 Computational logic

## 2.6.1 Binary format

A processor is, in very oversimplified terms, a collection of transistors. These components have two states, **on (1)** and **off (0)**.

**State** refers to the output of a circuit. For example: if a circuit has one input and one output, and the input and output each have two states, then there are two combinations of state:
 - input off, output off
 - input on, output on

**Logic gates** are series of transistors connected to give one or more outputs. For more, see [2.7 Logic gates](/theory/02/LOGIC_GATES.md). **Boolean algebra** refers to the notational equivalents shown in [2.7 Logic gates](/theory/02/LOGIC_GATES.md).

## 2.6.2 Truth tables

Here's an example of a **truth table** for an *AND* gate:
| A | B | Q |
| - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | **0** |
| 1 | 0 | **0** |
| 0 | 1 | **0** |
| 1 | 1 | **1** |

**Q** is the output of the condition.
