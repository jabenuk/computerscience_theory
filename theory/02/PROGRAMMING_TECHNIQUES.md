## 2.2.1 Use of variables

A variable is **a named memory address that stores a value.** The name of a variable is known as the **identifier.** Variables must be declared first before being defined. This can normally be done on the same line, if preferred.

**Constants** are variables that cannot be changed.

A **global** variable can be accessed throughout the program. In Python, the `global` keyword is used, whilst in good languages, the `public` and `static` keywords are the equivalent. **Local** variables are confined to a scope.

## 2.2.2 Operators

There are three types of operators:
 - **arithmetic operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
 - **boolean operators:** `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, etc
 - **logical operators:** `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not)
